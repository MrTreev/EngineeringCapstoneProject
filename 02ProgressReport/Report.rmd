# Executive Summary

# Introduction

# Statement of Problem
Stress is an ordinary physical response to everyday circumstances and challenges. Stress is comprised of both mental and physical components and when it arises, the human body automatically releases adrenaline and other hormones as a natural response. Stress can be quite useful when under control as it allows humans to be productive and efficient. However, stress, left unchecked, can quickly spiral into unproductivity or anxiety.
Identifying and understanding periods of elevated stress could significantly increase our understanding of how stress relates to productivity and long-term health. Studies indicate that devices which monitor Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Body Temperature may be useful in the analysis of stress levels. HRV (a measurement of heart rhythm over time), EDA (a measurement of the changes in skin conductance) and Body Temperature provide insights into the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The ANS is responsible for the sending of signals to the body which either stimulate or relax different involuntary processes (such as heart rate, sweat secretion and body temperature) (Chung, 2021).
The consequences of untreated stress are vast and have a ripple effect across a personâ€™s physical and mental health. Aligned with the growing use of telehealth and telemedicine for stress management, wearable technology that both monitors the physiological indicators of stress and provides feedback to the user are becoming more widely accepted. Thus, having a wearable device that can monitor key physiological signals associated with the Autonomic Nervous System could provide key insights into the levels and effects of stress.
This project will aim to investigate the materials and methods of construction for wearable devices and then verify these findings through the development of a stress monitoring wearable device. This project will require knowledge of core electronic principles including microcontrollers and sensors, as well as basic textile skills. Project success will be determined by mainly the wearability of the device and accuracy of the data.

## Design and Research Questions
The design and development of a wearable continuous stress monitoring device can be broken down into two, neat categories. The first being the identification of signals and sensors that can be used to monitor stress and the second, where on the body is an optimal location to place the various components. The following research and design questions are largely based on those present in the project proposal however, this version expands further, into more detail:
1.	How to identify levels of stress via physiological signals and sensors?
	a)	Which physiological signals correlate to stress?
	b)	Which sensors can be used to measure the identified physiological signals?
		i)	Should Heart Rate be measured via ECG, or PPG?
		ii)	Should skin temperature be measured from one or more locations?
			-	How often to collect skin temperature data?
		iii)	How to measure sweat rate?
			-	How often to collect sweat rate data?
		iv)	How to calibrate such sensors?
	c)	How to visualise acquired data?
		i)	Can off the shelf data visualisation platforms be used?
		ii)	Can spreadsheets be used to analyse prototyping data?
	d)	How to transmit data from the wearable device to visualisation platform?
		i)	Should Bluetooth or Wi-Fi be used?
		ii)	How often should data be transmitted?
		iii)	Should data be compressed on the MCU?
		iv)	Should the MCU do any pre-processing of data?
	e)	Which components to be used?
		i)	What are the optimal operating ranges (voltage, temperature, etc)?
		ii)	What are the associated budgets for each component?
	f)	How to power the device?
		i)	What battery voltage to use?
		ii)	Where to attach the battery?
		iii)	How to charge the battery?
			-	Detach the battery to charge?
2.	How to incorporate sensors into a wearable device?
	a)	How to reduce and minimise obtrusiveness?
		i)	Where on the body would this be achieved?
	b)	Which materials would facilitate the most comfort for the user?
		i)	For heart rate sensing would electrodes or optical sensing be more comfortable?
		ii)	Where on the body should heart rate, skin temperature and galvanic skin response be placed?
	c)	Where on the body would be the most effective location for the device?
		i)	How to transmit data from sensors to microcontroller?
			-	I2C?
			-	SPI?
		ii)	How would this position affect signal acquisition?
		iii)	How would this position affect wearability?

## Low-Level Design


## Component Selection

### Heart Rate Sensor
The major constraints decided upon for the heart rate sensor were the ability to be worn comfortably without impeding the sensor, the ability to communicate with common MCUs, and to be able to collect the heart rate data in real time. To this end we found seven different heart rate sensors from various suppliers and had to narrow them down further. We ended up choosing the SparkFun Pulse Sensor since it is very small and has flexibility of placement.

### Galvanic Skin Response Sensor
We were unable to find a sensor which fit our requirements for cost and size so we are going to be building our own GSR sensor as it is a relatively simple undertaking compared to the other sensors in our project. We will however be using a Grove GSR Sensor in order to calibrate our sensor and ensure it functions properly.

### Skin Temperature
For measuring skin temperature the main constraints for the sensor were

1. Temperature range including 20-45 Degrees Celcius
2. 3.3V Operation
3. Compact Profile
4. I2C Functionality

We looked through the sensors available at Core Electronics, DigiKey, and JayCar and found the sensor that best fit the requirements whilst being relatively cheap was the AHT20 Temperature and Humidity Sensor. We chose this one because of it's small form-factor, abundant documentation, low price, and the potential to measure sweat levels using the humidity sensor built in.

### MCU
The MCU being the central componant of the system must have certain requirements in order to be usable with this project.

1. Small Form-Factor
2. I2C Functionality
3. Sleep Mode
4. Arduino Compatible
5. Low Power Consumption
6. WiFi/Bluetooth Functionality

The MCU we decided to use is the ESP32 due to it's extensive documentation, sleep mode, extremely small form-factor, Wifi/Bluetooth functionality which can be processed in parallel with the rest of the operations on the chip. For development we will be using the ESP32-PICO-KIT Development Board due to it's built-in programmer, Prototyping pins, and relatively small size.
