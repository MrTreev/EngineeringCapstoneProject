# Executive Summary
The aim of this report is to develop a detailed plan with respect to the completion of the project. A general overview of completed tasks is provided and a brief explanation of the current stage of the project. The report will then provide a list of tasks that need to be completed, to achieve what the team set out in the project proposal. Overall, it will become clear the limitations the current device possesses, and the methods employ by which we hope to proceed towards a version which is appropriate for commercialisation. To visualise the expected trajectory of the project, a Gantt chart is provided with both a high-level overview and a more detailed breakdown of sub tasks. The project team aims to develop an unobtrusive version of the device with comprehensive functions which increase usability.

# Introduction
With the growing popularity of IoT technologies and the continual development of computational power relative to size, wearable technologies are expected to become an indispensable and integral part of our daily life. A valued adoption of wearable technology includes the use of wearables to enhance health monitoring more specifically stress monitoring. Stress is any physical, chemical or emotional factor that causes the human body to release hormones which consequently elicits other bodily responses such as increased muscle tension, higher pulse rate and generally increased alertness. Stress plays an important part in people's daily lifestyles having both short-term and long-term effects when not managed properly, thus this ultimately ushered in the opportunity to develop a wearable device that is capable of measuring stress whilst being integrated on the wearer's body. The current prototype of our device is capable of reading sensor data from our microcontroller and displaying the data on a mobile device, however further developments are still required to make our prototype fully functional. 

The main aim of this completion report is to provide an outline of the tasks required to complete the development of a wearable device that can capture data related to stress.  The tasks required include research, design and engineering, and an extensive timeline has been established to ensure that milestones are met, and the development is on track to finish within the time allocated. Furthermore, for the required tasks that need to be completed, a risk matrix has been created to evaluate any obstacles or pitfalls that the team may encounter for the duration of the project, and contingency plans have been put in place to prepare for the possibility of certain scenarios. 

# Completed Tasks
To date, the completed tasks in aggregate have successfully achieved the construction and testing of a prototype which demonstrated the ability to collect measurements of the three main physiological signals: galvanic skin response, skin temperature and pulse. The prototype was then able to display the data on a web server hosted on the microcontroller and accessed via web browser. Figure \ref{fig:PhysicalDevice} demonstrates the physical aspects of the device and Figure \ref{fig:WebBrowser} illustrates the web browser access portal.

## Tasks Completed
An itemised list of completed tasks categorised into engineering and research is as follows.

### Engineering
1. Design of a circuit which can record skin conductivity measurements.
2. Design of electrodes for use with the skin conductance sensor.
3. Testing the design and implementation of electrodes.
4. Testing of circuitry to collect and filter skin conductivity measurements.

### Research and Literature Review
1. Investigation of options for sensors to collect physiological signals
2. Preliminary research into PPG, GSR, ECG, EEG, and Skin temperature.
3. Preliminary research into testing procedures.
4. Preliminary research into physiological signals with a relationship to stress.

## Current Limitations
The current state of the device, being a prototype, is restricted in functionality. Firstly, the device currently has no method of securely mounting to the body without completely restricting movement while testing. Secondly, the web server is currently hosted directly on the microcontroller. Whilst this increases the speed of development, it restricts both the amount data able to be stored as well as the accessibility of the data.
\newpage

# Tasks to be Completed
The following itemised list of tasks to be completed aims to resolve some of the above listed limitations and develop the device into a fully functional system. The intention of each task is briefly outlined.

## Research
1. Review of mounting options\
	Research into the different potential locations for sensor placement given the literature on body mobility, sensor efficacy, sensitivity to locomotion, and other factors which could influence the placement of sensors on the body.
	1. Pulse Sensor: Ensure the signal for the heartbeat is significantly above the level of noise and variability during locomotion.
	2. GSR Sensor: Ensure the signal for the GSR is consistent with the commercial sensor when mounted during testing.
	3. Temperature Sensor: Ensure the reading from the temperature sensor is only influenced by skin temperature and external factors are negligible
2. Sensor placement locations
	- Research into the different methods of mounting PCBs (Flexible, Rigid-Flex and Rigid) will be conducted by looking through existing wearable devices, DIY projects, and commercially available attachment systems for suitable methods to mount the PCBs and other components to the human body in a way that does not interfere with data collection for the device and provides a high level of comfort.
3. Research of testing procedures
	Research different testing procedures used throughout literature to measure stress levels in order to determine the best testing procedure for our system.
4. Methods to derive stress from collected data
	Research through the existing literature to determine relationships between the physiological signals being measured and stress, as well as collecting the potential methods for categorising stressed and relaxed states used in literature to better inform testing procedures.
5. Research Battery and Charging Options
	Investigate options which can both sufficiently power the device and simultaneously possess a small form factor to limit the impairment of mobility of the user.
6. Investigate power saving methods
	Identify methods by which power consumption can be kept to an absolute minimum. This may include sleep modes of the microcontroller and or special functions of sensors.
7. Investigate options for PCB material
	Identify the possibilities for materials and construction of the PCB which contains the GSR sensor and the Temperature Sensor.

# Mitigation Strategies
This section intends to preemptively identify possible solutions to the complications and obstacles identified above. It will likewise be categorised the same way as the previous section. The number of each mitigation strategy refers to the corresponding risk.

## Research
1. In the case that preexisting literature does not exist to support our claims or advise our future decisions, relevant testing will be conducted.
2. In the case that existing literature is found that alters the course of our project, the project team will conduct an evaluation of the current state of the project and significant components that could be reused in the continuation of the project down a new path.
3. In the case that an appropriate option cannot be found to appropriately power the device, an auxiliary power device could be used to demonstrate the feasibility and work that has been completed to date.
4. If an appropriate relationship cannot be determined between the physiological signals and stress, the project will be modified into a health monitoring system which will not require any additional components.
5. In the case that flexible PCBs are not found to be appropriate for the application, or that they obstruct regular movements of the user, an appropriate solution will have to be found.

## Engineering
1. In the case that manufacture of the PCBs is delayed, the PCB design will be included as an item for future development and the Veroboard will be used for the final demonstration.
2. In the case that the purchase of the componentry is delayed , alternative components will be utilised where the originals cannot be reasonably acquired.
3. If faults exist within the manufacture of the PCB, and a reasonably expected amount of testing cannot determine the root cause the Veroboard will be used to construct a method of demonstration.
4. To address the database relationship risk, a database schema will be created and thoroughly mapped.
5. If models are not optimized for frequent queries, an alternative mitigation plan is to sacrifice some user experience for performance.
6. If the PHP script can’t communicate with the microcontroller, the prototype network architecture will be used as a backup.
\newpage

## Design
1. In the case that an appropriate design of the custom GSR sensor cannot be achieved, an off the shelf GSR sensor will be used.
2. In the case that an appropriate design for the skin temperature sensor PCB cannot be achieved, the AHT20 development board already acquired will be used.
3. If appropriate locations cannot be determined for the sensors, the best-fit locations we determined for testing will be used for each sensor
4. If appropriate locations cannot be determined for the components, the additional components will be put into a small bag and carried with the user
5. If an appropriate sizing of the custom PCB cannot be identified, it will determine that mobility with respect to movement of the user will be sacrificed. Subsequently, the system may be demonstrated irrespective of human connection.
6. If the user interface and layout don’t meet the UX expectations, a possible strategy is to begin rapid prototyping starting from early stages of development.

## Testing
1. Stress will be first defined as a physical, mental, or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension and refined from there.
2. We will begin by using processes found in literature to categorise the physiological signals into stressed and relaxed and refine the processes from there
3. See all above strategies

## Other
1. Ensuring that regular scheduled meetings with both the project and supervisors are undertaken.
