### Sweat Rate
Sweat rate can be measured in multiple ways, counting drops using an amperometric system, impedence based measuring system[@steijlen2020], hydrogel, or microfluidic channel based system[@yorkus2020]. Some sweat sensors even analyse different componants in the sweat through conductivity and impedance measurements. One of the older methods of measuring sweat is described in [@salvo2010] which uses two humidity sensors to measure the level of moisture generated by sweat. More modern patches use electrodes connected to microfluidic reservoirs to measure the speed and volume of sweat travelling through an area[@steijlen2020] [@yorkus2020] as these can be made smaller, more flexible, and significantly less intrusive.

## Internal Data Transmission
Internal data transmission, we hereby define as the transmission of data between components of a system without the use of Over-The-Air (OTA) communication such as Bluetooth, WiFi, LoRa, etc. The main method of internal data transmission in traditional rigid electronics is through traditional printed PCBs. These materials are not very suitable for wearable electronics as they cannot endure large amounts of flexion without breaking. One novel technology which has been around for many years that attempts to solve this issue is Flexible Silicon Fibres (FSFs) [@healy2004]. These fibres present an alternative to the copper wires and traces of a traditional PCB and connect components together in a flexible, electronically functional way. One of the next major innovations in internal data transmission was the flexible PCB (FPCB) which could withstand high amounts of flexion, however as it is still a plastic foil, the FPCB can not undergo stretch which is required in many wearable applications. The next major innovation was the Stretchable PCB (SPCB). This, in one instance [@stellaproject], involved embedding copper wires in an elastic flexible substrate in a two-dimensional spring such that stretch is possible in one axis without damaging the circuitry[@vieroth2009].

A good deal of sensors also use forms of one-wire communication such as the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor[@DHT11] which uses a time-based coding of the signals in order to transfer data bi-directionally over one wire. Other projects also use signal multiplexing to send signals from a microcontroller to different LEDs [@noda2017].

One of the newer developments in data transmission through textiles is through the printing of conductive materials into the fabrics [@guo2019] This allows custom circuits to be attached to the clothing without adding any noticable thickness and can be used as a cosmetic addition to the clothing. Another approach to deposition of conductive materials onto a substrate such as textiles, silicon, glass, etc [@cooper2020].
